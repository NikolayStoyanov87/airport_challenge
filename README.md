Created an airport application  to control airport operation's like landing , taking off ,airport capacity and permissions to land planes and take off planes depends of the weather condition and airport capacity.
Used separate files for different classes and different classes specs.


* Unable to complete the last step of the challenge because I ran out of time.
As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
